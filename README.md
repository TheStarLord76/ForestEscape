##### Game Summary

    Forest Escape is a traditional 2D platformer that features elements such as multiple platforms, chasing and patrolling enemies, and a focus on a smooth user experience. Several characteristics of Forest Jump include jumping, platform traversal, camera follow, objectives, and multiple endgame states (winning and losing). The defining aspects of Forest Escape include the overall user experience and chasing enemies which make use of the `A* search algorithm` to heuristically generate the shortest path to the player. Additional features include health mechanics, timer bar, and collectibles. The premise of Forest Escape is simple a fox must escape a burning forest, but before doing so, it must collect ten coins and then will be able to escape the forest. The game will be primarily playable online using a WebGL build (but other builds can be easily constructed using the ![Unity Game Engine](https://unity.com/))
